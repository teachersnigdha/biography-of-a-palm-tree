```
The palm tree is CA, Nirimakhiti,
Looking into the distance,
Her sorrow is gone, Apasora,
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.
The palm tree is CA. ... (1)

One morning, half in the body,
Burning in the fire,
Who are you, human, burning body,
It's getting worse.
The palm tree is CA. ... (2)

Her burning body, the eyes of the policy,
Finds her soft mind,
I don't understand, my heart aches,
How deep is it?
The palm tree is CA. ... (3)

Behold, the judgment of the Lord,
Its fruit is garnished,
Hanging up, smiling,
Anande CA Bivor.
The palm tree is CA. ... (4)
```

> Based on true events.<br>
> Seeing how much penta palm grows on a palm tree half burnt<br>
> I look, I often see my eyes on this tree, one day suddenly<br>
> You see, green is a new age. The palm tree is burning in<br>
> the fire after that ...
